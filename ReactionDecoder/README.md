# ReactionDecoder

If you want to automatically atom-map reactions, download ReactionDecoder from [Github](https://github.com/asad/ReactionDecoder/releases) (tested with `rdt-2.4.1-jar-with-dependencies.jar`), put the jar file into the folder `ReactionDecoder` (within the ehreact package folder) and rename the file to `ReactionDecoder.jar`
